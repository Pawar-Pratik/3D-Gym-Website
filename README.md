  -This website is not responsive, so use only <strong>Laptops</strong> to checkout (resoution : 1920*1080) <br>
  -Links and inputs are not working.<br>
  -As website processes 150 frames please give 10 seconds to load website.<br>
  -Also I tried to keep website minimal, by using 4 colors. <br>
  -Try playing with scrolling gesture.
</p>
<br>
<h3>This is my 1st 3D website</h3>
<p>Thats why i mainly focused on working of 3D models animation on scroll gesture, I'll make next 3D website more working.</p>
<br>
<h3>Things I learned</h3>
<p>
  - The animation is done by me, which i created by using <strong>Blender</strong>.<br>
  - And the scroll gesture controlling the animation is done by <strong>javascript</strong> only.<br>
  - Whole designing part is first done on <strong>book</strong> and then on <strong>Figma</strong>.<br>
  - And at last designed website is developed using <strong>HTML</strong> & <strong>CSS</strong>
